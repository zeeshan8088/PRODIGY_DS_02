🔎 Just completed Task 2 - EDA & Data Cleaning as a part of my Data Science Internship with Prodigy InfoTech!

I explored the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns in survival across gender, class, age, and fares using Python libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.

📊 Created meaningful visualizations and cleaned messy real-world data.
